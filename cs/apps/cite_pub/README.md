# `cite.pub`

Permanent and specific citations for other reference
material.

# Main workflow

1. Upload a file or provide a URL to cache it 'forever'.
2. Save a SingleFile.js-copy HTML of a URL, PDFs, images, or
   text files (only\*).

\* Keeps things simple for a user... save a permanant
data-type.

Files should be as small as possible to provide convincing
context for a citation, i.e. one page of a paper instead of
the whole paper.

Many 9s of reliability lol
