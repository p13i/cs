Open a Github Codespace (via the green "Code" button on the
homepage of this repo). Your dev environment will
automatically be ready-to-go. Run `make` from the terminal
and open port 8000 to view the main graphics simulator:

The raytracer implementation is based on Pharr et al.'s
[_PBRT_](pbr-book.org).
